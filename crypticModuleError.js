This error occurs when you are using a third-party library that has a dependency conflict with another library in your project.  The error message might not be very specific and simply indicate that a module is not found, or there are multiple versions of the same module causing conflicts. For example:

```javascript
import {SomeComponent} from 'react-native-some-library';
// ... later in the code ...
<SomeComponent/>
```

This might throw an error like `Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-native-some-library'` even if the library is correctly installed.
