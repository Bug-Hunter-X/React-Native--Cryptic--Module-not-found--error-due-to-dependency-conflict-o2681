Several strategies can resolve dependency conflicts:

1. **Check `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`):** Carefully examine your project's dependency tree for conflicting versions of libraries. Tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` can help visualize the dependency tree and identify conflicts.

2. **Version Specificity:** Use precise version numbers in your `package.json` to ensure compatibility. Avoid using `*` or `^` unless necessary, as they allow for potentially conflicting updates.

3. **`yarn resolutions` (or `npm-force-resolutions`):** If you have a dependency conflict that is difficult to resolve by adjusting version numbers, you might use yarn's resolution feature to force a specific version of a package. This should be used with caution. 

4. **Clean Installation:** A thorough project clean and reinstall can sometimes resolve discrepancies. Delete your `node_modules` folder, `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`), and then run `npm install` or `yarn install`.

5. **Examine Third-Party Library Documentation:** Some third-party libraries might have specific installation instructions or known compatibility issues that are documented.

**Example Solution (`crypticModuleSolution.js`):**

This example uses version pinning to resolve the conflict.  Replace the placeholders with the actual conflicting packages and desired versions.

```javascript
// package.json
{
  // ...
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-some-library": "1.2.3",
    "conflicting-library": "4.5.6" // Or another specific version
  }
  // ...
}
```

After making these changes, run `npm install` or `yarn install` again.
